							The dataset includes detailed information such as retailer names, invoice dates, geographical regions, states, cities, beverage brands, price per unit, units sold, total sales, operating profit, and operating margin. 
							The dashboard enables users to gain valuable insights into the performance of various beverage brands under CocaCola and retailers across different locations. It was created using visualizations made from Pivot tables created.<br><br>
